There are things you can't write down. Create. Collaborate. Share.

After 4 years of not touching the code, I think it's ready to be open-sourced. :) With ~40K Blackberry downloads and 5K website visits, tons of positive feedback, I hope this will still be useful for some, altough time has passed over this project, mostly making the Android and iOS version old looking, and legacy. I wrote this as a uni project When I was 20.

Bug reports, feature ideas, comments, questions are welcome in the repo!

***** Transatlantic tic-tac-toe with grandkids
Great app. Kids love to play hangman, tic-tac-toe (any paper and pencil game)...math questions. They'd rather "share board" than "skype".

#What is Shared Board?

Draw anything, and your partners viewing that board will instantly see it. The main purpose is to educate through Internet, but can be used in many ways. Share ideas while sketching!

Essentially a shared white board, it allows you to open a group room so anyone who is in that group can contribute their suggestions visually on the white board screen. Each user who attends the group has the ability to mark up the screen as well as send chat messages. You are able to select your marker color, sponge (erase) and add text. You can add an image or take a photo and use it as the background image on the screen. Once you are finished, everyone can save the board as an image.

#FAQs:

*I cannot connect/cannot see anyone.*
Unfortunately -as it is a P2P app- some firewalls block the connection. Make sure that no firewall is banning the addresses and ports 50.57.90.134 :1935 and 192.168.56.1 :54305. Remember to give the same group name on every device you want to connect, and the server will connect you.

*How to change color and size?*
You can long-press or right-click for the small menu. You can Swipe_down on playbook, or use the small menu to get the full menu. There is a custom color icon, and there you can change size, and select the color you want in RGB.

*What about security?*
You can always view, how many people can actually see the conversation. It is marked as an approximation, but under 5 it is perfectly accurate. However, a good hacker can still trick any system. Do not send sensitive information over the app! Remember, if someone joins, he/she won't see the previously drawn and sent messages, only a clean, black board.

*How does it work?*
The program is written in Adobe Flex (yes, it runs on Adobe Flash platform, even on iOS), complied from the same project for each target platforms. The connection is 'centralised peer-to-peer', so when you enter a group name, it will ask the Adobe Cirrus server for the participiants in the group, and from then, you only connect via p2p.
